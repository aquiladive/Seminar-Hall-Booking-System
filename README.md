## General Info
The app is made to be used by mainly three groups: 1) visitors (which can be students or faculties), for viewing upcoming events in the halls, 2) heads of department, for requesting to book events in either hall, 3) members of the Placement Cell, for approving or rejecting requests.

Approved events are displayed on the event calendar for each hall, along with the responsible department and the timeslot of the event. Clicking on an event name will also provide a brief description of it.

In this way, a user-friendly and efficient application has been developed.


## Technologies
* Front-end: HTML and CSS, alongside the libraries Bootstrap and Font Awesome.
* Back-end: Python, particularly the Django web framework.
* Database: MySQL.


## Other Info
